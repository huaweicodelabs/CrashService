## Introduction
AppGallery Connect (AGC) provides a lightweight crash analysis service. Based on the Crash SDK, the AppGallery Connect (AGC) can be quickly integrated with zero code. Your app can automatically collect crash reports when it crashes. This demo provides you with a way to integrate the crash service into a Harmony OS application.

## Supported Environments
DevEco Studio 2.1 or later.

## Configuration
Before you can run the Quick Launch application, you need to:

1. If you do not have a HUAWEI Developer account, you need to register an account and pass the authentication.
2. Log in to AppGallery Connect using your account, create an app, and select HarmonyOS as the package type.
3. Click the created app, choose Development > Quality > Crash, and click Enable Now to enable the Crash service.
4. Download the agconnect-services.json file from AppGallery Connect and replace the JSON file of the quick start application.
